This week we expected to finish the general menu and start with log in.
====================================
This week we finished the general menu, made the log in, started dividing the menu into 4 sub-menus by the 4 roles that a user can have, created a DTD schema, started xlst and created a DTD checker.
------------------------------------
We divided the work into 2 mini-groups of 2 people each one. One for making all related with JPA and nother one for XML.

Next weeks we expet to finish the programming and fix the diagrams mistakes, because lots of changes have been made.
