This week we expected to define the features and start with the UML, following the suggested progress.
=========================================
This week we did the UML schema, the UML tables and started the case diagram.
------------------------
We stablished the base of our project as well as the 5 main clases. However, we didn't have time to define the features.
========================
Next weeks we will define the features, create the repository, add all the Progress Reports and all the schemas, finish the case diagram and learn how to use GitHub.
